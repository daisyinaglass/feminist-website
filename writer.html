				<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sarah-hendricks/9a/605/a42" target="_blank">Sarah Hendricks</a> is a sophomore at American University studying Print Journalism and Computer Science.</p> 
				<p>She chose to create an imaginary 1970’s radical feminist publication and adapt it to the web. All articles are original, pictures have been credited. Black-and-white hand drawings were picked specifically for their frequent appearance in real dissident publications during the time period. Photos were chosen based on when they were published and similarity to those found in radical newspapers and magazines.</p>
				<p>This website was coded by the author entirely by hand using HTML and CSS.</p>
